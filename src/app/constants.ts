  "I am a career switcher from Corporate Finance (7 years) to Software Development, currently refining my skills as a Junior Web Developer. My experience at Proximus involves building data dashboards and internal tools using Angular and Python APIs.",
  "My background in finance taught me the importance of structured problem-solving and translating complex data into clear, actionable insights—skills I now apply directly to software engineering. I am a student at 42 Belgium, where peer-to-peer learning and project-based curriculum are fundamental.",
  "When I am not in the 'severed' state of deep work, I enjoy dancing and sports like mat pilates and running, reading, and watching series like Severance and The 3 Body Problem. This website was inspired by Severance and built using Angular and TailwindCSS."
